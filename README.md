## Building a Dynamic Database Web API in .NET 9 Using Clean Architecture and MediatR
Flexibility in database selection is critical in modern application development. 
A Web API should support multiple database options such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite without major code changes. 
In this project, we will build a .NET 9 Web API using Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and MediatR, while implementing dynamic database selection using Entity Framework Core (EF Core).
